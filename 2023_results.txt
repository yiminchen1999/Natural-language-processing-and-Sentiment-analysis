I then found additional code that I could add to change shapes and colors of the "sprites" so I experimented with the dots, polygon and star shape
Each one reacted differently - the polygon had a "collide" and "bounce" reaction, whereas the star held the sprites inside of its borders

The code remix was quite challenging when I was getting started and trying to figure out how to use the libraries

My first thoughts before disassembling the camera were to:
1
Try to salvage and/or utilize the "main" components (lens, screen, buttons, lights)
3
Ideas of what to recreate ranged from a charger, to getting the screen to turn on,
to making an aesthetic art piece, to a telescope from the lens

Disassembling Phase:
I used a screwdriver to easily take apart the camera
There were a series of different boards inside along with the obvious of lenses, lights, batteries, the screen
I am unsure what the orange strips were, my one thought is that they function as the "wires" to send signals to the various boards
Once I saw the hole that the main lens left when it was removed I then had the thought "I could make this a speaker!"

Revision Phase:
I make Bluetooth speakers with my students, so I knew I had the supplies to make this happen
I used a Dremel to remove some plastic for a 9V battery to fit inside the case, as well as had to Dremel down the switch to make it fit in the original button hole
Once I soldered the switch and  glued in the speaker, the last (most challenging) part was to reassemble the case and screw it all back together

Reflection
I wish I paid closer attention when disassembling the case because the most challenging part was reassembling it

As I think about the word "repair" I used to associate it with fixing a current object in order to restore its original function
However, after reading Rethinking Repair, I began to understand that repair is beyond just fixing something, but rather the beauty of repair is that it can become something totally new
Originally, I was so focused on "needing" to use the electronics of the camera that I felt stuck, but once I allowed myself to be okay with not using those components I really enjoyed creating something entirely new within its case

We  needed something that would carry the water without absorbing it, so wood wouldn't work without another material on top
We found this tube and began researching simple machines (specifically levers and pulleys) as a way to move the tube
We found a motor that we could make into a pulley, we just needed to find something heavy enough (hockey puck) to actually move the tube

Prototyping & Moments of Learning
We attached the hockey puck to the pulley using a strong plastic typed material and used a spring to distribute the weight so our motor could turn the hockey puck pulley enough

Eury found a great wood piece that could hold our tube once we found a way to attach the wood the table (it was magnetic but it wouldn't stay on any white boards)
Eury found a great wood piece that could hold our tube once we found a way to attach the wood the table (it was magnetic but it wouldn't stay on any white boards)
Our only issue then was to ensure the tube would stay on same part of the wood each time, tipping in the same location so it would hit the sensor reliably

We laser cut some circles that were slightly bigger than our tube and glued 2 together after realizing only 1 allowed the tube to move too much, and attaching 3 gave too little flexibility
When the "cotton balls" were too wet, they were too heavy and did not slide
When there was only 1-2 "cotton balls", they did not always build up the momentum to move
When we used a combination of a few fish, a few blue stones, and more "cotton balls" that were moderately wet, we found the most success
Reflection Card: Working with a partner was really helpful for this project because we were able to brainstorm and problem solve together, incorporating two different perspectives into the design
This process taught me about force, weight, gravity, and friction in a hands on way that did not require the use of equations specifically, but rather shaped our understanding of the math behind it through these concrete objects
The combination of coding and 3d movement, similarly as with the laser cutting assignment, demonstrated switching between 2d and 3d seamlessly

New design idea 1:
I wanted to make a snake game/"fish eat fish" type of experience and realized that it would be too difficult

After playing around the code, I realized that frameRate() is a intersting function so I kept it

New design idea 2:
I got interested in this movement and wanted a drawing effect to show the trail/track of the movement

I did not know how to search for the effect I wanted at first
Luckily, I found this resource in p5
New design:  Art tool (and a math learning tool)

Changes made based on the original code
1
Added a slider to control the frame rate and a clear button to reset the canvas

A user can adjust the frame rate with the slider
When the rate is higher, the lines are denser from before and present a different artistic feeling

I tried changing the color and length of the strokes in the code
Given more time, I will build them as buttons or sliders for users to play with

I now know how to debug and solve problems on my own
First I created a rectangle to put inside the buttons
I didn't know how to do the buttons, but with the help of Akio and the references I was able to create
Play the video to see the code working!

I didn't understand how to clear my canvas, so I decided to create an erase by giving the same color of the canvas to the brush
But after I was able to create the reset button :)

Idea + Blueprint: I got so intrigued and excited when I first saw the mobius strip at TLTL
It was fascinating given that we can make something bendable out of the rigid wood
I realized mobius strip resembles the feather(train) of the male peacock
Trial & Error: I had to play with mobius strip svg file to get the exact degree of curve that I wanted for the peacock's feather(train)
Final Stage: I made three little rectangle-shaped cuts on the edge of the mobius strip to insert it on the side-edge of the peacock's body and stabilize the feather(train)
But now I became an inventor who could make the toolkit for the animal 3D wooden puzzle and it makes me feel like I--as we--am forging community altogether and empowered/get more agency of belonging

The Meditation Sounds:
I first converted youtube sounds to mp3 and then uploaded them into my p5
I knew what I needed to happen and what the computer needed to be told to make it happen, but it took me a bit to figure out the correct 'if, else' statement to make it happen
Even if it not exactly how I "wanted" to code it, it still functions
The article “Rethinking Repair” made me think about the concept of repair as I worked through this assignment, and that it goes beyond fixing broken items, but also thinking about repurposing and reusing

Used a tool to fix the wood into the table
Because the previous group was finishing their move at the edge of the table, we built a ramp to continue the moving path
So, we decided to use a car pattern design, cut on the laser cut machine, commonly used in robotics learning settings

THE CODE
While we were assembling our ramp and car, we coded our GogoBoards

THE CODE
While we were assembling our ramp and car, we coded our GogoBoards
Following the tilt action, the first GogoBoard would signal the second to trigger the car motor and play music
Once the engines are on, they should turn the wheel clockwise attached to them and move straight ahead until the end of the ramp
Once the engines are on, they should turn the wheel clockwise attached to them and move straight ahead until the end of the ramp
The testing was a nightmare
First, we couldn't start the engines together and turn the wheel in the same direction
We changed the code, motors, wheels, and car weight and even turned the engines on opposite sides

THE SIMPLE MACHINE
We decided to build a ramp as a simple machine
We used the laser cut for the ramp and sides because we needed precision
We used the laser cut for the ramp and sides because we needed precision
And the legs we cut at the wood saw and wood sander machine
However, we were unsure about the ideal angle for the ramp, so we employed an adaptable feature to connect its parts: hinges
Using the hinges was an excellent decision because when we were testing the car walking, the ramp was too tilted, so effortlessly, we adapted the angle by putting the ramps from part higher
Using the hinges was an excellent decision because when we were testing the car walking, the ramp was too tilted, so effortlessly, we adapted the angle by putting the ramps from part higher
Also, we decided to inflate the balloon more so the plastic area was finer (good decision)
We used some pieces of wood to weigh on the pole bottom and try to balance it
It was not enough! The final solution was to wrap the pole with the ramp's last part legs

I got more experience using the laser cutting machine
It was really difficult for me to sketch and plan before using the laser cutter because the logic didn't make sense in my head, until I did my first printing iteration

Prototypes & Final Design

Reflection Card: After my first print, seeing how all the pieces should fit gave me a lightbulb moment that supported my understanding
Then, I was able to improve the design for both fit and style a few more times and change what parts of her would be attached to which pieces
This reflection process of the modifications I could have made with more time created a second lightbulb moment, so now I feel much more equipped to actually design and execute laser cut projects in the future

Thus, when I disassemble it myself, I do not have a complete idea of its functionality, its pros and cons
It accounts for the durability of the old, but also the appearance of the new”

Before disassembling it, I wish I had learned more about the time when the machine existed, its history, the culture around it, the meaning it carried, and the value people expected from its use back then
If I could have had more depth of feeling and awareness of the object before disassembling it, it might have evoked more of my emotions and thinking
I can then generate more ideas and inspiration when I use the disassembled parts to design new objects
However, I have gained a lot from this disassembly process
It was an enjoyable experience, and I'm proud I didn't destroy or force any part of it during the disassembly
During "decomposing" and "disassembling", I was amazed at how intricately each piece interacted with the other

TINKERING WITH THE CODE
1- I read line by line to understand the code and its functions;
2 - For the functions that I couldn't understand, especially the ones that used Cos and Sen calculations, I changed the number to observe changes
platform helped me translate to p5
Js language what I wanted to do on the code, but I didn't know how to write it
Remix Code
1 - my first test was to change the fixed pattern numbers by setting up the initial pattern with my birthday date;
2 - as a coincidence, the createPattern(120, 5
Due to this, I decided to add music to my remix code

When all the parts were draw, I laser cut my prototype
First in cardboard and then on MDF
I made adjustments in each one of them so it would fit the way I imagined
Becoming familiar with the laser cut was an exciting experience for me
One of my biggest inspirations for my laser cut project was my daughter's book
Overall, it was a fun and satisfying experience to see my designs come to life through the use of the laser cut
I tried sketching their bodies, but their mouth/beak was a problem
Coincidentally, I found the "donkey wood animal" that belonged to my grandfather
Because I was using my computer without a mouse to manipulate the platform tools and wanted the drawing to be as proportionally as possible, I first used geometric squared forms to create the body (Image 1)

So, again, I resort to a physical prototype to help me emulate how the connections would happen (Image 4)
" Because I used the rubber function to erase the lines or shapes I wasn't going to use, the first print considered these "shadows" and cut them
Second, the machine was not working, so we used the "new" laser cut
Seeing my draw on the wood on the previous digitally printed page was great, but it didn't work
The laser did not cut through the wood, making it impossible to disattach the animal body parts without ruining them

The "old" laser cut was fixed, and it printed perfectly
However, once I tried to connect the parts, I realized that the fitting parts were too wide and the legs could pass through them
If the connections fit, the animal's legs, head, and tail would be motionless

In redesign, I realized that the frameCount means that the ellipses are moving further apart, which makes the flowers appear bigger, but kind of ruins my heart shape in redesign

Circle shaped wood (cut by laser cutter) circumscribe the pipeline
Circle shaped wood (cut by laser cutter) circumscribe the pipeline
The number of wood determines the maximum angle of the slant of the pipeline
That is, we realized that the number of wood circles and angle of the slant are inversely proportional
finding the optimal balance

Error 2: mislocation of the pipeline & the pulley
Weight of the pulley does not hit the pipeline
Error 3: Too much water (soaked in the cotton) cause too much friction and thus hinder the water transfer
Error 4: dislocation of the pipeline on the wood plate below
Followings are some concept that I encountered while building the station: a) finding the center of gravity through proper string tension, b) water can also cause friction (due to its weight) when it is absorbed into a sponge-like material, c) integration of levers and pulleys, d) finding the optimal balance between power levels and time intervals during the gogoboard coding process

Ideation:

I love ducks! I collect rubber duckies and my family calls me ducky, so I knew I wanted to make a duck
I googled a few laser cut duck ideas
I began by sketching out my ideas of what pieces I would need to make this duck
I then brought a rubber duck image into Illustrator and used the pen tool to cut out each piece

Prototype:
I cut out my images in Illustrator and decided to make the little "hooks" to hold the wings
I then cut everything onto cardboard to test it out
Successful score attempt
Failed latch attempt

Once I knew my simple design would work, I then began to play around with how I could make the duck's tail wiggle

In order to get the detail on both sides of the duck I had to reflect the body and the wings and then engrave on both sides
The idea is that he is a snorkeling duck!

This project took a lot of reiterations and perseverance
However, making measurements exact so that things could slide into place as well as attempting to add an element of difficulty by making the duck wiggle really made me go through many iterations before everything worked

I need this to be a reflection

I embody the online-offline contrast by creating a tape collage to represent the offline experience, highlighting the colorful yet noisy online conversations, while I used soft and solid cotton dyed in red, green, blue and yellow, together with small objects on top that help simulate a dreamlike micro-environment to represent the intimacies of offline experience
Reflection:
Reading Jackson's essay makes me rethink the realtionship between objects and meaning, especially in a world that is so intellectually oriented
In my own practice of dissecting and repurposing an old object, an old flip-phone, I really try to think about its original use and meaning  for people, then how I can develop new, or even opposite meaning in it

I chose to take apart a portable charger
The outside had an aluminum tube protecting it and the only other visible parts were the charger ports (one USB, one Micro USB)
There also was plastic on top and the bottom
I knew there would be a circuit board, battery, and wires connecting them inside
When I began taking the portable charger apart, I had trouble taking the outer plastic casing off
I used a variety of tools and eventually decided I would need to break some of the plastic
Once the top was off, it was easy to slide the rest of the aluminum casing off
A majority of pieces are plastic besides the aluminum casing
A majority of pieces are plastic besides the aluminum casing
There also was a screw
The actual portable charger was made of a circuit board, connected by 2 wires to a battery, as anticipated
The circuit board had a copper wire wrapped around a spool on top, assumably for conducting energy
The aluminum and plastic parts are more decorative and protective, whereas the circuit board and battery are structural

I recently have moved a lot and don't have a lot of materials, and struggled to think of how to repurpose this with what was available
So, I simplified my goal and used the aluminum aspect, the plastic cap on the bottom, and tape to reattach the pieces

Then, I thought it could be repurposed as a dog toy (putting treat inside for my dog to get out)

This process helped me reflect on the ways we must have a plan to critically use technology
As Jackson (2014) illustrated, technology is often made (like the MacBook Pro example) in ways that make it extremely difficult to repair and not necessarily environmentally friendly
Creating and repurposing technology in sustainable ways requires the maker to critically engage with the materials around them in ways that prevent additional waste
This process also made me reflect on the importance of patience
I ended up creating something that is not useful, and so it does not constitute a worthwhile repair or sufficiently salvaging the materials
Repair is a big part of my family traditions as my father and grandfather both are mechanics, and so I was raised in a tradition of repairing whatever we could, and although I have more experience with repairing non-electronics I am looking forward to gaining practice in this realm

Sketches and prototypes

A new skill I learnt: How to make a hinge/connecting parts: Make sure the slot that's cut open has the same width as the thickness of the material I'm gonna use

V1-- creating a 3-D dog
V2-- calculating to create the connecting pieces
V3-- fine tuning
What should the diameter of the slots be? Where should I place them? What should the shape be? How can I design the slots for the middle piece so I can fit the wings in there securely? My first sketch for the slot kept me up until 4am that day since I was determined to calculate all the length and then turn them into ovals

Inspiration

Drawing: prototype

I chose to create a sea turtle as I grew up in Florida, which is one of the nesting/hatching areas along the Atlantic coast
Drawing: Final

Prototype, cardboard cutout

I realized the importance of printing cardboard prototypes during the process
Drawing: Final

Prototype, cardboard cutout

I realized the importance of printing cardboard prototypes during the process
For example, in one prototype, the printer cut the pieces instead of engraving, and some of the connecting pieces were too big or too small
Once I was able to correct all of these issues, I then printed the final draft on plywood
Reflection Card:
I enjoyed this process of working with the laser cutter and creating the omni animal
It did require a few tries and adjustments before all of the pieces fit together for the final product
It was difficult to get the sizing of the connecting pieces exactly right, so I finally had to use sandpaper to get the connectors to fit in the egg
Idea 1: Gears
Our input is the humidity sensor and output is the tilt/shake sensor
Initially we wanted to make a wall of gears that rotate

A lot of gears work in vertical ways are very beautiful! And the noise is powerful!

We planned to laser cut the gears and found ready-made, free design online

We also prepared other directions in case the gears don't work out

Unfortunately, the gears idea did not work out
The tilt/shake sensor can only send out signal when its face is turned 90 degrees
Gear connect with a fan?

I searched wooden toy online before, and had the idea of adding fan blades to one of the gear to create wind, as a way to "shake" things

Besides, I have always liked the design of bamboo dragonflies (竹蜻蜓 in Chinese) and wonder if I can actually make it and make it fly

I went through a lot of trials and errors to finally understand how to "do 3D design" on the wood in order to draw the right angles and form the curves

Understanding is not enough, wood cut skill is also required

Test 3, we then tried different plastic bag to help the ice cause we suspect is the weight and the size of the bag that interferes with the falling process
However, after testing, we exclude that is not the case
At the end, we added a tape to the ramp so it will provide some smoothnesses and less fraction  to the falling process
Further, instead of putting ice into the bag, we changed to put the sensor into the bag and let the ice falls freely

At the seventh time, we finally make it work!

We added metallic tape to create a slide effect on the seesaw, which allowed the ice to slide much faster
We then found that the motor was better able to support the weight of the seesaw if we  secured it above the seesaw, rather than at the same level, so we taped it to the wooden post

For instance, when we want to make sure that the motor steadily stays on the wood stick and above the ground, we need to find a way to dig a hole in the vertical stick since hot glue and wood glue are neither strong enough to hold the motor in place

I decided finally on this project:
My comments can be found here and below: This code drew me in because of its use of sine
I've always felt called to the natural waves of sine curves, and in this case, it felt connected to water and breathing, which are both very calming for me, so it felt appropriate to remix
I started off using more complex codes from open source libraries, and was frustrated trying to figure out what they were saying
Instead of being frustrated at what I did not know, I moved into simpler codes and practiced translating what I did know and understanding! Although many of my translations didn't "translate" into my final project, they were crucial steps in the beginning/middle to my exploration, applying, learning, and reflecting,

At first, I was browsing aimlessly looking for ideas and just trying to understand what different codes were saying
This practice sparked my interest in creating a visual that could encourage pausing, and taking a few deeper breaths
I like this code because it had a movement element that I felt could convey similar movements to breathing
When completing my remix, I tried adding pictures, gifs, appearing/disappearing text, shaders, and rotating circles, but it all felt too complicated for the message I was trying to convey

Insight

LVN (which I got to know at MIT media lab) is a AI-powered listening and analytic tool help users see patterns across conversation, identify theme, and highlight voices around what matters most in the community
Getting data from LVN, I extracted the keywords in NY and Education that happened in Manhattan which is my current community and put them into the array of my code and so that they could be displayed on the screen
The orbit rotation also represents the shape of  manhattan
(which is tilted little right)

We realized that the pulley was not able to lift the weight of the seesaw holding the ice, and also the friction of the wood was preventing the ice from sliding all the way down
We realized that the pulley was not able to lift the weight of the seesaw holding the ice, and also the friction of the wood was preventing the ice from sliding all the way down
We added metallic tape to create a slide effect on the seesaw, which allowed the ice to slide much faster
We then found that the motor was better able to support the weight of the seesaw if we  secured it above the seesaw, rather than at the same level, so we taped it to the wooden post

For instance, when we want to make sure that the motor steadily stays on the wood stick and above the ground, we need to find a way to dig a hole in the vertical stick since hot glue and wood glue are neither strong enough to hold the motor in place

First, I felt empowered opening a technological artifact and using various tools traditionally attributed to man
I was used to thinking about repairing technology as a man's task: the person that always fixed artifacts in my home was a man
Second, repairing instead of using new materials was a way to care for the environment and our technologies
Jackson (2014)  invites us to build a strong relationship with objects and take care of them and proposes an ethics of mutual care and responsibility, called repair-centered ethics paradigm

It reminded me the video at Heliopolis work, where students made a ship with a helix repurposing objects
Second Idea

Try out the fan, as I forgot to plug in the microwave to test if it was working
It worked !!!

I decided to put a switch to pick if I wanted to turn it on or off
Megan helped me to use a multimeter to measure the voltage
Fourth idea

Stick metallic and colorful stars in the helix to see a nice effect

What I learned from this process is don't expect the result to strictly align with your conceptions because whether a design works in reality can only be know after trial
However, it turns out that the elaborate veins on the outer layer will make the whole prices fall apart if the size is too small, because the laser will burn the edge of the material and shrink the actual size

so then we worked backwards to decide how to get the phone stand to stay up and then when released fall over
We utilized the simple machines website to help us develop various ideas of how to incorporate an incline plane and a pulley system

The incline plane involved some adjustments as we added in the servo to "open the door" for the marbles and therefore had to cut a slit in the wall

If we had planned this out better then we could have put the slit and holes in before creating the stand

The pulley was quick to make by making a base and to walls and I was able to repurpose a wire spool to allow the string to rotate through

Super simple - we just created a box, but we had to measure out where to place the box so the phone lands on it without tipping over, and with that had to weight the box down so that it stayed still when the phone fell on it
Code

When receive a message -- servo moves 90 degrees to open the door, which releases the marble down the incline plane
When the marble passes the distance sensor on the plane it triggers LED lights (ADD CODE IMAGES/TALK ABOUT CODING IT)

Reflect 

	•	We could have planned out our incline better about creating holes for the "door" and the distance sensor before putting it together
	•	We could have created a more secure way to use the pulley to hold down the phone case

Akio sent us a very nice tutorial and we experimented with the Arduino blocks to code the neo pixel
Because the previous group was finishing their move at the edge of the table, we built a ramp to continue the moving path
So, we decided to use a car pattern design, cut on the laser cut machine, commonly used in robotics learning settings
Coding the GogoBoard

THE CODE
While we were assembling our ramp and car, we coded our GogoBoards
Coding the GogoBoard

THE CODE
While we were assembling our ramp and car, we coded our GogoBoards
Following the tilt action, the first GogoBoard would signal the second to trigger the car motor and play music
Once the engines are on, they should turn the wheel clockwise attached to them and move straight ahead until the end of the ramp
Once the engines are on, they should turn the wheel clockwise attached to them and move straight ahead until the end of the ramp
The testing was a nightmare
First, we couldn't start the engines together and turn the wheel in the same direction
We changed the code, motors, wheels, and car weight and even turned the engines on opposite sides

THE SIMPLE MACHINE
We decided to build a ramp as a simple machine
We used the laser cut for the ramp and sides because we needed precision
We used the laser cut for the ramp and sides because we needed precision
And the legs we cut at the wood saw and wood sander machine
However, we were unsure about the ideal angle for the ramp, so we employed an adaptable feature to connect its parts: hinges
Using the hinges was an excellent decision because when we were testing the car walking, the ramp was too tilted, so effortlessly, we adapted the angle by putting the ramps from part higher
Using the hinges was an excellent decision because when we were testing the car walking, the ramp was too tilted, so effortlessly, we adapted the angle by putting the ramps from part higher
Also, we decided to inflate the balloon more so the plastic area was finer (good decision)
We used some pieces of wood to weigh on the pole bottom and try to balance it
It was not enough! The final solution was to wrap the pole with the ramp's last part legs

I added flames  to the base to symbolize the burning fire
Reflection Card:
The biggest takeaway I have from this assignment, besides the lovable firework smell comes from the laser cutter and knowledge and skills of how to use the machine
My realization is that although having a good idea and illustrating it or visualizing it is extremely important
The importance of learning while doing is even greater!
Take my experience, for instance, I had drawn many drafts on Inkscape before going to the lab, but it wasn’t until I actually learned how to use the laser cutter that I realized that many of the ideas I had drafted were hard to implement in the real world, which I hadn’t anticipated
Conceiving an idea a hundred times on the computer or in your head is not the same as learning how the machine works, using it and cutting stuff out, and then assessing where it needs improvement
It was intriguing to see how the notion of "repairing" was articulated as a "timely phenomenon bridging past and future", namely "aftermath", which inherits the layered world and entails continuity of "order, value, and meaning" (Jackson, 2014)
In my project, the phone slider and the movable monitor stand were manifested as embodied instructional material of the number system and provided the embodied structure of 2 players game, respectively
I think the original purpose of the embodied design affordance was sustained and transformed throughout the “repair” process and the project entails a portion of the essence of the aftermath–continuity (of order and value) and resilience

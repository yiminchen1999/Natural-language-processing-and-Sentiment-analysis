I was able to change the directions in which they moved and adjust the speed by updating the velocity

I then found additional code that I could add to change shapes and colors of the "sprites" so I experimented with the dots, polygon and star shape
Each one reacted differently - the polygon had a "collide" and "bounce" reaction, whereas the star held the sprites inside of its borders

The code remix was quite challenging when I was getting started and trying to figure out how to use the libraries

New design idea 1:
I wanted to make a snake game/"fish eat fish" type of experience and realized that it would be too difficult

After playing around the code, I realized that frameRate() is a intersting function so I kept it

New design idea 2:
I got interested in this movement and wanted a drawing effect to show the trail/track of the movement

I did not know how to search for the effect I wanted at first
Luckily, I found this resource in p5
New design:  Art tool (and a math learning tool)

Changes made based on the original code
1
Added a slider to control the frame rate and a clear button to reset the canvas

A user can adjust the frame rate with the slider
When the rate is higher, the lines are denser from before and present a different artistic feeling

I tried changing the color and length of the strokes in the code
Given more time, I will build them as buttons or sliders for users to play with

I now know how to debug and solve problems on my own
First I created a rectangle to put inside the buttons
I didn't know how to do the buttons, but with the help of Akio and the references I was able to create
Play the video to see the code working!

I didn't understand how to clear my canvas, so I decided to create an erase by giving the same color of the canvas to the brush
But after I was able to create the reset button :)

Along with my code is possible to read my pseudocode where I explain my choices

I wanted to add a button but didn't know how, so I looked for references and even sought help from ChatGPT
With Akio's help and my own research, I was able to find a simple code that I felt comfortable with
I dedicated a significant amount of time to styling the code and making it look good
This project was especially meaningful to me as my daughter had asked me to draw on my computer using paint, so finding a suitable code was a fun challenge

The Meditation Sounds:
I first converted youtube sounds to mp3 and then uploaded them into my p5
I knew what I needed to happen and what the computer needed to be told to make it happen, but it took me a bit to figure out the correct 'if, else' statement to make it happen
Even if it not exactly how I "wanted" to code it, it still functions

TINKERING WITH THE CODE
1- I read line by line to understand the code and its functions;
2 - For the functions that I couldn't understand, especially the ones that used Cos and Sen calculations, I changed the number to observe changes
platform helped me translate to p5
Js language what I wanted to do on the code, but I didn't know how to write it
Remix Code
1 - my first test was to change the fixed pattern numbers by setting up the initial pattern with my birthday date;
2 - as a coincidence, the createPattern(120, 5
Due to this, I decided to add music to my remix code
Due to this, I decided to add music to my remix code
Once I wrote the code, the pattern start point changed from one drawing to another, and it did not spin
As a learning reflection, this was a challenging assignment
Additionally, CHATGPT made coding more inclusive to me once it helped me translate my thoughts or commands to p5
js , leaving me with the logic functional coding part

Original Code of the Project

For me, the most challenging part of dissecting the original code was first, determining which object was actually moving, was the background that was moving? Or the train, or both? My answer to that question came from "messing around" with different parts of the code in order to figure out each code's purpose

Here is where I learned about user interaction through mouseIsPressed boolean

In redesign, I realized that the frameCount means that the ellipses are moving further apart, which makes the flowers appear bigger, but kind of ruins my heart shape in redesign

I don't understand how the effect of frameCount affects the shape of the flowers, both in placement and creation

Changes to Code:

I went through a few different coding iterations, trying out different ideas in an html format using a shader and htlm

Ultimately, I moved away from this because although I could create the html and add text, I couldn't get the p5
js codes for shaders to run properly after 4 days
I decided finally on this project:
My comments can be found here and below: This code drew me in because of its use of sine
I've always felt called to the natural waves of sine curves, and in this case, it felt connected to water and breathing, which are both very calming for me, so it felt appropriate to remix
I started off using more complex codes from open source libraries, and was frustrated trying to figure out what they were saying
Instead of being frustrated at what I did not know, I moved into simpler codes and practiced translating what I did know and understanding! Although many of my translations didn't "translate" into my final project, they were crucial steps in the beginning/middle to my exploration, applying, learning, and reflecting,

At first, I was browsing aimlessly looking for ideas and just trying to understand what different codes were saying
This practice sparked my interest in creating a visual that could encourage pausing, and taking a few deeper breaths
I like this code because it had a movement element that I felt could convey similar movements to breathing
When completing my remix, I tried adding pictures, gifs, appearing/disappearing text, shaders, and rotating circles, but it all felt too complicated for the message I was trying to convey

Insight

LVN (which I got to know at MIT media lab) is a AI-powered listening and analytic tool help users see patterns across conversation, identify theme, and highlight voices around what matters most in the community
Getting data from LVN, I extracted the keywords in NY and Education that happened in Manhattan which is my current community and put them into the array of my code and so that they could be displayed on the screen
The orbit rotation also represents the shape of  manhattan

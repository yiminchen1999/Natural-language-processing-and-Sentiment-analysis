Idea + Blueprint: I got so intrigued and excited when I first saw the mobius strip at TLTL
It was fascinating given that we can make something bendable out of the rigid wood
I realized mobius strip resembles the feather(train) of the male peacock
Trial & Error: I had to play with mobius strip svg file to get the exact degree of curve that I wanted for the peacock's feather(train)
Final Stage: I made three little rectangle-shaped cuts on the edge of the mobius strip to insert it on the side-edge of the peacock's body and stabilize the feather(train)
But now I became an inventor who could make the toolkit for the animal 3D wooden puzzle and it makes me feel like I--as we--am forging community altogether and empowered/get more agency of belonging

As shown in trial & error #1 picture, I had to play with the shapes (comb pattern) to get the shape I desire and it led me to comprehend the general mechanism of Mobius strip, which I was not able to get when I was doing heads-on only
As a beginner using design tools on the computer and little experience with the laser cutting machine, I decided to start from a simple design and see how it worked

I got more experience using the laser cutting machine
It was really difficult for me to sketch and plan before using the laser cutter because the logic didn't make sense in my head, until I did my first printing iteration

Prototypes & Final Design

Reflection Card: After my first print, seeing how all the pieces should fit gave me a lightbulb moment that supported my understanding
Then, I was able to improve the design for both fit and style a few more times and change what parts of her would be attached to which pieces
This reflection process of the modifications I could have made with more time created a second lightbulb moment, so now I feel much more equipped to actually design and execute laser cut projects in the future

The illustration technique used in the drawings are painted tissue and collage
When all the parts were draw, I laser cut my prototype

First in cardboard and then on MDF
I made adjustments in each one of them so it would fit the way I imagined
Becoming familiar with the laser cut was an exciting experience for me
One of my biggest inspirations for my laser cut project was my daughter's book
Overall, it was a fun and satisfying experience to see my designs come to life through the use of the laser cut
I tried sketching their bodies, but their mouth/beak was a problem
Coincidentally, I found the "donkey wood animal" that belonged to my grandfather
Because I was using my computer without a mouse to manipulate the platform tools and wanted the drawing to be as proportionally as possible, I first used geometric squared forms to create the body (Image 1)

So, again, I resort to a physical prototype to help me emulate how the connections would happen (Image 4)
" Because I used the rubber function to erase the lines or shapes I wasn't going to use, the first print considered these "shadows" and cut them
Second, the machine was not working, so we used the "new" laser cut
Seeing my draw on the wood on the previous digitally printed page was great, but it didn't work
The laser did not cut through the wood, making it impossible to disattach the animal body parts without ruining them

The "old" laser cut was fixed, and it printed perfectly
However, once I tried to connect the parts, I realized that the fitting parts were too wide and the legs could pass through them
If the connections fit, the animal's legs, head, and tail would be motionless
Quackie is content and enjoying the quiet winter for now, but soon will be eager for his prime time in the summer!

Ideation:

I love ducks! I collect rubber duckies and my family calls me ducky, so I knew I wanted to make a duck
I googled a few laser cut duck ideas
I began by sketching out my ideas of what pieces I would need to make this duck
I then brought a rubber duck image into Illustrator and used the pen tool to cut out each piece

Prototype:
I cut out my images in Illustrator and decided to make the little "hooks" to hold the wings
I then cut everything onto cardboard to test it out
Successful score attempt
Failed latch attempt

Once I knew my simple design would work, I then began to play around with how I could make the duck's tail wiggle

In order to get the detail on both sides of the duck I had to reflect the body and the wings and then engrave on both sides
The idea is that he is a snorkeling duck!

This project took a lot of reiterations and perseverance
However, making measurements exact so that things could slide into place as well as attempting to add an element of difficulty by making the duck wiggle really made me go through many iterations before everything worked

Sketches and prototypes

A new skill I learnt: How to make a hinge/connecting parts: Make sure the slot that's cut open has the same width as the thickness of the material I'm gonna use

V1-- creating a 3-D dog
V2-- calculating to create the connecting pieces
V3-- fine tuning
What should the diameter of the slots be? Where should I place them? What should the shape be? How can I design the slots for the middle piece so I can fit the wings in there securely? My first sketch for the slot kept me up until 4am that day since I was determined to calculate all the length and then turn them into ovals

I also learnt about the differences in materials --- my pieces were fitting together when printed on cardboard, but not mdf

I chose to create a sea turtle as I grew up in Florida, which is one of the nesting/hatching areas along the Atlantic coast

For example, in one prototype, the printer cut the pieces instead of engraving, and some of the connecting pieces were too big or too small
Once I was able to correct all of these issues, I then printed the final draft on plywood
Reflection Card:
I enjoyed this process of working with the laser cutter and creating the omni animal
It did require a few tries and adjustments before all of the pieces fit together for the final product
It was difficult to get the sizing of the connecting pieces exactly right, so I finally had to use sandpaper to get the connectors to fit in the egg
What I learned from this process is don't expect the result to strictly align with your conceptions because whether a design works in reality can only be know after trial
However, it turns out that the elaborate veins on the outer layer will make the whole prices fall apart if the size is too small, because the laser will burn the edge of the material and shrink the actual size
Got inspirations from different materials (cotton, plush yarn, bell) available in the lab
The story of Baa-Baa the sheep
Baa-Baa lives in children's mind and imagination
It connects to topics like measuring, geometry, balance

Learning by doing: Learned design thinking, iterative/agile design, project management, time management naturally in the process
Time flies so fast and again I don't even realize that I am learning
Build self efficacy: I made 3 prototypes before the final decision
When the prototype finally worked, I felt really happy and had the confidence in myself: I can solve problems
Get really useful feedback from them as inspirations for next iteration

Design & Hand-drawing on Inkspace
Final prototype

I added flames  to the base to symbolize the burning fire
Reflection Card:
The biggest takeaway I have from this assignment, besides the lovable firework smell comes from the laser cutter and knowledge and skills of how to use the machine
My realization is that although having a good idea and illustrating it or visualizing it is extremely important
The importance of learning while doing is even greater!
Take my experience, for instance, I had drawn many drafts on Inkscape before going to the lab, but it wasn’t until I actually learned how to use the laser cutter that I realized that many of the ideas I had drafted were hard to implement in the real world, which I hadn’t anticipated
Conceiving an idea a hundred times on the computer or in your head is not the same as learning how the machine works, using it and cutting stuff out, and then assessing where it needs improvement

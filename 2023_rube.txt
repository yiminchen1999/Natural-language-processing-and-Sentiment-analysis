We  needed something that would carry the water without absorbing it, so wood wouldn't work without another material on top
We found this tube and began researching simple machines (specifically levers and pulleys) as a way to move the tube
We found a motor that we could make into a pulley, we just needed to find something heavy enough (hockey puck) to actually move the tube

Eury found a great wood piece that could hold our tube once we found a way to attach the wood the table (it was magnetic but it wouldn't stay on any white boards)

Our only issue then was to ensure the tube would stay on same part of the wood each time, tipping in the same location so it would hit the sensor reliably

We laser cut some circles that were slightly bigger than our tube and glued 2 together after realizing only 1 allowed the tube to move too much, and attaching 3 gave too little flexibility
When the "cotton balls" were too wet, they were too heavy and did not slide
When there was only 1-2 "cotton balls", they did not always build up the momentum to move
When we used a combination of a few fish, a few blue stones, and more "cotton balls" that were moderately wet, we found the most success
Reflection Card: Working with a partner was really helpful for this project because we were able to brainstorm and problem solve together, incorporating two different perspectives into the design
This process taught me about force, weight, gravity, and friction in a hands on way that did not require the use of equations specifically, but rather shaped our understanding of the math behind it through these concrete objects
The combination of coding and 3d movement, similarly as with the laser cutting assignment, demonstrated switching between 2d and 3d seamlessly

Used a tool to fix the wood into the table
Because the previous group was finishing their move at the edge of the table, we built a ramp to continue the moving path
So, we decided to use a car pattern design, cut on the laser cut machine, commonly used in robotics learning settings
Coding the GogoBoard

THE CODE
While we were assembling our ramp and car, we coded our GogoBoards

THE CODE
While we were assembling our ramp and car, we coded our GogoBoards
Following the tilt action, the first GogoBoard would signal the second to trigger the car motor and play music
Once the engines are on, they should turn the wheel clockwise attached to them and move straight ahead until the end of the ramp

First, we couldn't start the engines together and turn the wheel in the same direction
We changed the code, motors, wheels, and car weight and even turned the engines on opposite sides

THE SIMPLE MACHINE
We decided to build a ramp as a simple machine
We used the laser cut for the ramp and sides because we needed precision

And the legs we cut at the wood saw and wood sander machine
However, we were unsure about the ideal angle for the ramp, so we employed an adaptable feature to connect its parts: hinges
Using the hinges was an excellent decision because when we were testing the car walking, the ramp was too tilted, so effortlessly, we adapted the angle by putting the ramps from part higher
Using the hinges was an excellent decision because when we were testing the car walking, the ramp was too tilted, so effortlessly, we adapted the angle by putting the ramps from part higher
Also, we decided to inflate the balloon more so the plastic area was finer (good decision)
We used some pieces of wood to weigh on the pole bottom and try to balance it
It was not enough! The final solution was to wrap the pole with the ramp's last part legs

Circle shaped wood (cut by laser cutter) circumscribe the pipeline
Circle shaped wood (cut by laser cutter) circumscribe the pipeline
The number of wood determines the maximum angle of the slant of the pipeline
That is, we realized that the number of wood circles and angle of the slant are inversely proportional
finding the optimal balance

Error 2: mislocation of the pipeline & the pulley
Weight of the pulley does not hit the pipeline
Error 3: Too much water (soaked in the cotton) cause too much friction and thus hinder the water transfer
Error 4: dislocation of the pipeline on the wood plate below
Followings are some concept that I encountered while building the station: a) finding the center of gravity through proper string tension, b) water can also cause friction (due to its weight) when it is absorbed into a sponge-like material, c) integration of levers and pulleys, d) finding the optimal balance between power levels and time intervals during the gogoboard coding process

Initially we wanted to make a wall of gears that rotate

A lot of gears work in vertical ways are very beautiful! And the noise is powerful!

We planned to laser cut the gears and found ready-made, free design online

We also prepared other directions in case the gears don't work out

Unfortunately, the gears idea did not work out
The tilt/shake sensor can only send out signal when its face is turned 90 degrees
Gear connect with a fan?

Besides, I have always liked the design of bamboo dragonflies (竹蜻蜓 in Chinese) and wonder if I can actually make it and make it fly

I went through a lot of trials and errors to finally understand how to "do 3D design" on the wood in order to draw the right angles and form the curves

Understanding is not enough, wood cut skill is also required

Test 3, we then tried different plastic bag to help the ice cause we suspect is the weight and the size of the bag that interferes with the falling process
However, after testing, we exclude that is not the case
At the end, we added a tape to the ramp so it will provide some smoothnesses and less fraction  to the falling process
Further, instead of putting ice into the bag, we changed to put the sensor into the bag and let the ice falls freely

We added metallic tape to create a slide effect on the seesaw, which allowed the ice to slide much faster

Super simple - we just created a box, but we had to measure out where to place the box so the phone lands on it without tipping over, and with that had to weight the box down so that it stayed still when the phone fell on it

For instance, when we want to make sure that the motor steadily stays on the wood stick and above the ground, we need to find a way to dig a hole in the vertical stick since hot glue and wood glue are neither strong enough to hold the motor in place

With Akio's help, we tried four different drills/tools/woodcutters before we found the right one we needed!

input: Wifi receive
output:  Light

IDEATE:
Helen noticed that after making her phone stand in class that it did not function properly, so we decided to repurpose it into our project
After meeting we discussed various ideas, but landed on the concept that we wanted the phone to fall from the stand to cover the light sensor

After meeting we discussed various ideas, but landed on the concept that we wanted the phone to fall from the stand to cover the light sensor
so then we worked backwards to decide how to get the phone stand to stay up and then when released fall over
We utilized the simple machines website to help us develop various ideas of how to incorporate an incline plane and a pulley system

This image shows our sketching process after discussing our ideas

PROTOTYPE:
We broke the project into sections:

Incline Plane:

Pulley:

Light Box:

The incline plane involved some adjustments as we added in the servo to "open the door" for the marbles and therefore had to cut a slit in the wall
so then we worked backwards to decide how to get the phone stand to stay up and then when released fall over

Also, we retroactively deiced to add a distance sensor which involved late drilling a hole in order get the sensor to fit in

If we had planned this out better then we could have put the slit and holes in before creating the stand

The pulley was quick to make by making a base and to walls and I was able to repurpose a wire spool to allow the string to rotate through

Super simple - we just created a box, but we had to measure out where to place the box so the phone lands on it without tipping over, and with that had to weight the box down so that it stayed still when the phone fell on it
Code

When receive a message -- servo moves 90 degrees to open the door, which releases the marble down the incline plane
When the marble passes the distance sensor on the plane it triggers LED lights (ADD CODE IMAGES/TALK ABOUT CODING IT)

Reflect 

	•	We could have planned out our incline better about creating holes for the "door" and the distance sensor before putting it together
	•	We could have created a more secure way to use the pulley to hold down the phone case

Akio sent us a very nice tutorial and we experimented with the Arduino blocks to code the neo pixel
Because the previous group was finishing their move at the edge of the table, we built a ramp to continue the moving path
So, we decided to use a car pattern design, cut on the laser cut machine, commonly used in robotics learning settings
Coding the GogoBoard

THE CODE
While we were assembling our ramp and car, we coded our GogoBoards

THE CODE
While we were assembling our ramp and car, we coded our GogoBoards
Following the tilt action, the first GogoBoard would signal the second to trigger the car motor and play music
Once the engines are on, they should turn the wheel clockwise attached to them and move straight ahead until the end of the ramp
Once the engines are on, they should turn the wheel clockwise attached to them and move straight ahead until the end of the ramp
The testing was a nightmare
First, we couldn't start the engines together and turn the wheel in the same direction
We changed the code, motors, wheels, and car weight and even turned the engines on opposite sides

Akio helped us fix the code, although one wheel was faster than the other, which kept the car pending to the right and following through the ramp

The problem was an old glue that was left on the motor that made the wheel turn wrong

Once we got the bond out and set the right speed, the car drove ahead and nailed the ballon!

THE SIMPLE MACHINE
We decided to build a ramp as a simple machine
We used the laser cut for the ramp and sides because we needed precision

And the legs we cut at the wood saw and wood sander machine
However, we were unsure about the ideal angle for the ramp, so we employed an adaptable feature to connect its parts: hinges
Using the hinges was an excellent decision because when we were testing the car walking, the ramp was too tilted, so effortlessly, we adapted the angle by putting the ramps from part higher

Also, we decided to inflate the balloon more so the plastic area was finer (good decision)
We used some pieces of wood to weigh on the pole bottom and try to balance it
It was not enough! The final solution was to wrap the pole with the ramp's last part legs

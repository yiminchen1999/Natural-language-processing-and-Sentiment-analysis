Feedback from instructor for ideas from week 9
The overall feedback was that the directions were interesting
what if two ideas are integrated? (a simulator game in which the puzzle mechanics is incorporated
the idea that an absurd theory can be formed out of a combination of facts is possibly good

Brainstorm
I informally brainstormed with a friend at the lab
The idea that different perspectives can generate different comprehensions of facts was salient, and it led to another direction: a game inspired in Root. I spent a lot of time with a mental block, trying to come up with mechanics for this

Back to original idea
Then, I went back to the original ideas, with a twist: players would form news headlines using sets of words and images coming from different sources--reliability would depend on the source. I even started to prototype that in cardboard, but I kept thinking that the idea was not robust enough

Another brainstorm
The idea of a game kept coming, and I did another brainstorm.
The current iteration is a card game whose dynamics resembles Dixit
What I like about this idea is that it highlights the fact that personal perspectives and interests can impact how we tell stories and vouch for them
Also, the mechanics seems to hold up. I dry-tested with two friends and, while they offered some constructive feedback, they seem to see value in the game
And I'm currently exploring ways to integrate more technology to the mechanics.
One possible way is to have an AI player (I tested some interactions using GPT-3, and it seems promising).
Another possibility is using the computer to improve the score-marking method.

My rational is at the beginning of the current prototype:

Previous week's prototype:

Insight from testing it

It became clear that the mechanic was way too complex for this stage. Although I understand that an educational game (or intervention) can be complicated, I believe that, at this point, the complexity would make it harder for me to isolate the aspects that I plan to test. From there, I envisioned two possible directions:
simplify the mechanics, but keep the essence (a group game in which the players have to create news and identify when personal views are getting on the way of a reasonable account of facts);
simplify even more and make it a "single player" experience.
I went with the second option and wanted to test whether AI could serve as scaffold to the task of "creating" news (which was challenging, according to feedback)

My first prototype this week:

I started testing what AI could do with the task of creating headlines from keywords, then added criteria like ("include a generalization," or "include bias towards x"). The results were interesting (see example below).

So, I started creating a simulated learning experience with Google Slides. That allowed me to evaluate the potential of the idea in terms of number of prompts, possible outputs, etc.
I created 4 rounds (in two of them, the learner creates stories which get evaluated by AI; in the other two, roles reverse) plus an extra interaction in which the user and the AI evaluate each other's way of thinking.

With positive feedback from TAs, I went ahead and created a Figma prototype

The current prototype:
Finally, I created a (still non-functional) prototype using Figma, which afforded a better look and more flexibility with transitions. This is the link to the prototype in view mode.

I think that the past week has been the least efficient for me in terms of work vs results. I spent a large number of hours trying to figure out some technical aspects of my project and made little progress in terms of final product.
I started this week's work by debriefing the feedback from the crits and thinking about the technical feasibility of the idea I presented.

Instructions
Here are your instructions from designing using the Cricut software all the way to combining the pieces
Make a star next to your multi-layer design
Group the design together
copy and paste - make as many copies as there are different color layers that you will want to print separately
for each layer, select the star and make it the same color as the layer you want to print, hide the rest of the layers accept the one that will print, select all layers in the copy of the design and press link at the bottom of the page
repeat for each copy of the design
PRINTING
press “make it”
you will see that each color layer in your drawing is set up to print separately
prepare the first vinyl paper on the mat - and print in cricut
remove from mat
repeat for each color layer
Starting with your bottom most layer, cut a square around your sticker - big enough to fit your largest layer.
cut square around your design - make sure to include the star
remove the sticker outlining your sticker - leaving only your vinyl sticker and the star on the while paper (tip** - use the NAME OF TOOL to pick out the little detailed pieces from your sticker)
Starting with your penultimate layer - lay the transfer paper on top of your sticker use your hands or the cricut tool to press your sticker to the transfer paper
pull up the transfer paper - the transparent paper should now have your color sticker
take your design on the transfer paper, hold it over your first layer and align the stars
place the sticker layer down aligning the stars
use the NAME OF TOOL tool on the back of the original design paper to help stick the transfer paper
Remove the transfer paper slowly
tip* use your fingers to keep the sticker attacked to the white paper while pulling off the transfer paper
finally take your completed sticker off the sheet and place it wherever you like

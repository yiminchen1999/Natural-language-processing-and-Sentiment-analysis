Sketch and prototype
Gravit Sketch
Initially went for aÂ triangular body sketch to complement the geometric shell but that did not give enough room to connect other body parts

Tito the turtle
Reuse: Sandwich for Tito made from leftover pieces
Backstory
Tito the turtle is an endangered specie. It has adapted to a geometric shell in order to escape getting caught in the fishing gear which is one of the causes of its accidental capture. Sometimes, Tito likes to eat a sandwich.
Reflection
While creating this animal the most challenging part was to start with 2D. Having no prior experience, I was a little intimidated but as I practiced I got better. Initially I wanted to trace out a turtle's sketch. Here is when I decided to challenge myself and in order to feel more comfortable with 2D I designed all the parts myself. One thing that I did find myself practicing unintentionally was trying to avoid wasting the material and reusing whatever I had.

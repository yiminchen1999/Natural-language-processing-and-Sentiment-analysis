Rube Goldberg:  Pinball Station (Light Sensor & Temperature Sensor)
Introduction
Inspired by 3D pinball game, we created a station which is triggered by the second group's light sensor with above 10 input data.

Once it is triggered, after 3 seconds, the barrel set at the top of the station will turn 45 degrees for pouring out some little squares in there.

The dropping squares will pile over the proximity sensor set at the bottom of the station. Finally, the hair dryer will be turned on for heating up the temperature.

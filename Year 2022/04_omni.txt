Pompom is a friend's cat

Decided to go with a three piece cross section with a movable tail

Cardboard prototypes helped find flaws in my design such misalignment of measurements, lack of stabilization for the axel and pieces not fitting together.

3 cardboard prototypes and 2 failed MDF cuts before final cut was successful

Harder to tinker than coding, because physical materials involved, so tinkering had to be more thoughtful than just continuous play.

Attention to detail is important. Some precise measurements of the hole through wheels and tail axel changed while editing. Had to double check constantly.

The final cut was a success! Special thanks to David who brainstormed with me to solve problems that came along with stabilizing the wheel axel.

Pompóm Картошка Backstory

Pompóm Картошка is my friend's cat where Картошка is a Russian word that is pronounced "Kartoshka" and means potato. Not sure what Pompóm means. PomPom is a pretty lazy cat that likes to hang out when there are visitors at my friend's apartment. She always looks dazed, so the googly eyes fit here! Pompom also likes to wag her tail up and down when she is excited for food so her omni-animal version also has a movable tail.

0.original drawing
This is a drawing that daughter made of our dog back in Brazil. Its name is Gil
1. sketches on paper
I tried to imagine how the flat 2D image would be were it seen from the side--that was my first thought to turn it "3D”
2. Cardboard prototypes
In the first cardboard prototype, I forgot to duplicate the outer layers of the anima #facepalm
3. Final Cut file
3. images of Canis Gilius, my omni animal
The final result is a simple but friendly-looking animal. Sometimes I see a capybara in it, but I swear it is a dog
Canis Gilius has very varied dietary habit: it will eat both cables and spaghetti in a matter of hours; cheese of all kinds, toilet paper, and even dog food satisfy its refined taste.
The only possible form of reproduction for Gil is via CNC cutter, Instagram and Whatsapp pictures, perhaps some analog Polaroid pictures. The funny thing is that these are like Gil’s clones, but in inanimate form.
There have been bad wolves around his house. Although no aggression has ever been recorded, the wolves are said to be “very carnivore,” which is a reason for genuine concern.
Canis Gilius moves in a very unique way, by projecting itself forward and performing somersaults.

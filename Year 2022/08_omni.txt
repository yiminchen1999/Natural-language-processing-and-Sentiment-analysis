Bendable leg prototypes
inspiration for bendy arms from” https://www.instructables.com/Curved-laser-bent-wood/
Early trouble with metric system - way to big
drawing from talking through my design with TA Dave
broken wood prototype - cut on speed 40
Interesting learnings
Laser cutter speed effects the measurements of “dowels” a bit
for the wooden connector pieces across legs.

final: magnetic hands for “clasping” branch

Sticky Sloth
The sticky sloth has strong sticky hands that clasp together for tight holds on trees, branches. They are lighter than other sloths which makes it easier for them to hang on thin branches. The strong hold between their hands and feet allows them to stay hanging upside down even in  strong winds and more severe weather.

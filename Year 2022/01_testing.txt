The Components of Sound
After reading this section you will be able to do the following:
Explain what three things cause the differences in sounds. Intensity, pitch, and tone.
Discuss why some sounds are pleasing and others are not.

one distinction between music and noise is that noise consists of a mixture of frequencies whose mathematical relationship to one another is not readily discernible. music - simple mathematical relationships can be discerned with repeating pattern/rhythm

5th fret harmonic on E string = 7th fret harmonic on A string
5th fret harmonic on A = 7th fret harmonic on D string
5th D = 7th G
*no harmonics 4th fret G to open B
5th fret harm on B = 7th fret harm on high E string

^twelve tone scale/chromatic scale only 100 years old! 1920 by Shonberg

in diatonic scale, perfect fifth has.7 semitones

what if this were a game where the goal was "synergy" (visual and audio harmony) achieved when people standing in certain places fell within certain ratios? If anyone was not, the composite waveform and sound would be.. less resonant? Or not there? Only have audio when one of the core harmonics?

NOTES: learning physics through play
-said more plainly, can we take something that is complicated and often difficult to learn and teach it in a new way that uses the body to help learners understand a concept in ways that go beyond memorizing facts, formulas, and procedures?

critique notes: 
learning physics through play
have kids approach screen **PROVIDE VISUAL AND AUDITORY FEEDBACK**
show nodes/proportions and have
different locations of "harmony"
see more connection to math (audio and visual, math feedback) -utilize numbers? or some other way? at beginning or way?

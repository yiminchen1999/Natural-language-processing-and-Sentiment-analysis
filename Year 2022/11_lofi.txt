target learners: kids and adults who are interested in creating art using light, colors and patterns
we do not have strong colored LED at lab yet no so I used the multicolor LED to imitate the effect. By adding reflective/mirrored lens, we can have a more interesting visual effects.
My idea is by using light to create shapes that signal colors, users can create their own patterns by combining acrylic filters and LED lights of different colors
the learning goals:
1. to understand color theory
2. to understand optical effects  
3. create visual effects by using colors, shapes and light sources

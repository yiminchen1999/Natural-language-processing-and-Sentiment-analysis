Original image
Use "pen" to copy the bird's shape
It's so difficult to use pen to create vector lines!!!
Create different parts by copying the wings on the original image and shape
Add connecting slots and pieces and test whether the design work
Redesign the size of the slots and connecting parts. Learned how to create more standardized slots from other students. I created a small standardized rectangle firstly, and then create the slots by copying the shape of the rectangle.
However when I printed, I forgot to flip the head and the small wings. Therefore, the patterns were on the hidden side. Reprinted for several times because different problems with the setting of the laser cutter appeared unexpectedly.
I didn't expect that at the stage of the printing so many problems would occur. It is a not very pleasant (so tiring) but meaningful learning experience with the laser cutter.
First cut with card board - the  body pieces and the connecting parts do not match. SAD!
Final product!!
Omni-animal Cockatiel

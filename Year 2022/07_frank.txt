Reflection

When I looked at the moving box, I first recognized its original function – containing things. It can store things carefully and prevent them from being damaged. It also inherited the durability from its original material – wood, so as its wooden color. Its original material and physical form inspired me to restore it in another way– a tree-like necklace holder. Therefore, this holder maintains the durability and wooden color, but at the same time encountered a rebirth.
As Steven Jackson mentions in his article, maintenance, repair, and breakdown are not separate or alternative to innovation but are sites for interesting and consequential operations. From my personal understanding, in the process of repairing, innovative ideas and new technologies might occur. Their occurrence is not without foundation but is due to the purpose of repairing and maintenance. Similarly, the reason for me to repair the moving box is not to creatively build new things without a foundation, but to maintain its durability and functionality as a container.

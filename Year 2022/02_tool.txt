Description
We've designed the special Mona Lisa by using the Carvey machine. We tried to make the image to be more vivid and strong visual effects, so we played it with the colors, used a three layer acrylic material in white, red and white to create the blenders of colors. We have choose the finest bits in 1/16 to precisely adjust the curves and overall quality of the image as we planned.

Material and Instructions
Easel designs
The graphics design in the Easel. As shown in these two pictures that we used different cut depth to create different layers of the image to make strong visual effects.
The colored image in Easel, we used 3-color Acrylic by creating the combination of white, red and white.
The printing preview session, we select the material type. The existing material does not have the three layer type, so we choose the two layer material. We changed the configurations of the material dimensions: width in 6 in, length in 6 in, thickness 0.5 in to make sure that the product we print meets the requirements,

DISSECTED ARTIFACT

FINAL PRODUCT

Short* reflection
Creating my “Frankenthing” made me reflect on my trajectory as a “fixer.” When I was a child, I liked to tinker with components of radios, pocket calculators, an old TV that we had at home. On other occasions, I would surreptitiously use a lighter to melt parts of Kinder Surprise toys and create mutant figures. As I grew up, though, that “tinkering bug” went weaker, and, looking retrospectively, I see a few reasons for that. One of them is associated with the perceived status of those who fix and repair things. As Jackson notes, innovation and repair came to be seen as two extremes of the social order. That perception held true in that parochial town where I grew up: one is not really expected to try and fix things unless they are either an "real" engineer or a low-skilled, blue-collar worker. Since I was not good at math and physics, tinkering would automatically push me to the second category.

Jackson’s writing—mediating my experience producing my Frankenthing—also struck me with his questioning of the “fixer” having a different standpoint. Maybe, his words made me reflect, the fixer can really see value where others see waste. Ironically, isn’t this at the core of capitalist thinking (selling goods and services for more than the cost of producing them)? Indeed, one of the things that struck me when I moved to the U.S. was the ease with which online retailers simply “give up” on relatively low-cost goods, and unconditional reimbursement (instead of returning the product) is usual–”here, goods are way cheaper than service sector labor,” a friend noticed. Now, of course, I will not sell my “art installation.” However, as a subjective representation of a relationship that is dear to me, the reconfiguration of a product made the (new) sum of its parts way more valuable than its (old) whole.

*I was a bit clueless on how short this should be. I'm sorry if it is a little too long.

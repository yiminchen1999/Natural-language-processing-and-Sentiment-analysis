input: temperature
output: rain/soil humidity
brainstorm
prototypes
input of heat and output of water reminded of the water cycle system, water evaporating and then clouds letting precipitation go
vertical option
we want height for our seesaw/ramp to go down to a place that still has height for rain to "fall" from. How to achieve? Freestanding parts, or all secured to pegboard
our Gogoboard code was pretty simple, though needed to be tweaked based on the room temperature where we were testing

Reflection

As I created my Frakenthing it made me reflect on multiple ways in which things can be used. As someone who gets emotionally attached to stuff even when they break, it gave me an opportunity to use things that had an emotional value but no use. My parents do not throw away stuff and try to use it so I think I get this from them as I grew up in a house with a storage room with things such as a broken stereo, old cassettes and fans, etc.

The author uses the word Extension for repair which aptly describes the process of creating this keychain from broken pieces of jewelry. When I started planning, I decided to use the circular hook which I thought would fit perfectly (Attempt 1) but as I tried to attach the key, I realized the hook that apparently looked perfect could not hold the key. As I browsed through the stuff and looked at the taken apart earring, I decided to use the upper hook which would have probably made it into the trash can otherwise. In the authorâ€™s words I extended its use and utilized it as a tool to secure the broken chain and key together. This was perhaps the surprise that I encountered as I used a longer hook as opposed to the commonly used circular one. Experimenting with stuff that sometimes does not make sense on paper is another valuable thing I learnt from this process.

Moreover, learning through repair is more relevant and timely now that people are trying to move towards practices that are more environment friendly. Having workshops that help kids and adults engage in this form of making can not only be useful for the environment in terms of reducing waste but also a great opportunity to learn and use communal ways of knowing.

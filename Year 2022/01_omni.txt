BRAINSTORM
Fish with legs drawing - toddler adding legs to a fish so it could "move" (going on to theories and constructivism)
bluey!
cheetah, could cut holes for spots throughout

prototypes
freehand drawing of that goldfish plus cardboard design 1
thought this was basic haha, also wanted legs and thought of doing a plane another way so that legs would be easier
iteration 2 on the right, not measured and clunky but realizing the tail is too big. different fish that will be easier to be supported on lil legs

2D iterations
digital iteration 3 on gravit
digital iteration 4++ on gravit - added scales for textures and colors for engraved fins

Laser cut iterations
I decided to cut straight through the MDF for my fins so that it could be seen on both sides. I slightly tweaked the base plane by making the slots a little skinnier, recut the tail so the groove fit in better, but that was it! If i'd had more time I would've made a better leg configuration, but the awkwardness of the legs is by design.

Common name: yellow tang fish
food: algae
story: I was doodling with my daughter this week and traced a fish. She took the drawing and drew legs, stating that it would need them to move. I thought this was an interesting example of meaning making and theorizing and wanted to use it for my omni animal!

I was happily surprised that the "feet" added a solid amount of stability! We'll see if it is still standing in the morning...

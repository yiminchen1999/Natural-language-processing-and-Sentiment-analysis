Critiques from panel
Connecting computational thinking with social emotional learning (does sel involve computational thinking (the logic, the sequence, abstraction .... )
Considering children's literacy skills. Better if it can be visuals, graphics and pictures.
The actions, events, emotions is a little bit simple. How to extend the block units. What units can the kit have?
Under what learning settings? With whom it should be used? Teachers' scaffolding? Teacher <-> student interactions?
Critiques from Paulo
Add overlays (finding the patterns:what causes bad emotions, how people usually act under emotions ... a ebook that helps renegade decisions and predict outcomes)
Supporting materials (videos or books to guide through using the kit)
Technical suggestions from Jonathan
Fiducial and AR
Redesign - a complete toolkit
EmotionBlocks that enable children to explore emotions through tangible storytelling
Principle:
 Use pictures, use colors
 More blocks for more complex scenes (locations, actions, emotions, people, satisfaction, reactions)
 Use animal/cartoon characters
levels of emotions
images instead of words
EmotionDiary that prompt children to reflect and analyze patterns through AR phone application
Principle:
Automatically generated prompts for reflection
Why do you feel angry?
How do they feel differently?
Conversational agent to guide the scaffolding process
Collect sequential data and analyze the patterns
Storybooks that serves as a guide and prompts to start using the kit.

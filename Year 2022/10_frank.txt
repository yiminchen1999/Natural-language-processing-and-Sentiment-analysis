Reflection

I have encountered many problems when redesigning. I wanted to do something fancy with electricity, but it turned out to be lack of resources and capability, so I turned to something simple but more aesthetic and conceptual. I think the planning stage is especially important as for the design process, especially because I could have a more clear sense of what I need to do and have a rough timeline to finish things before deadline. In the future design projects, I will start earlier and spend more time on the planning stage.

As for the reading, the author mentions the difference between innovation and repair. Innovation, to people, is something new and fancy, while repair seems to be not as creative. From this project, I would say, repair is also a innovative process, and sometimes can advance the original design.

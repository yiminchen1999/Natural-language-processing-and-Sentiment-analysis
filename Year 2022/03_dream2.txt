[Part 3] Final

In the first demo of dream toy, I designed the llama that Imani wanted as a reward in the game. After communicating with Professor Paulo, I overturned this idea and redesigned the llama to be more closely integrated with the game.

After referring to the games, Count Your Chickens and Hoot Owl Hoot!, I decided to design a family board game for Imani that can involve her parents and friends.

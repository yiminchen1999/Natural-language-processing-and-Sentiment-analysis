using wire and chain to hang the jellysnake
Design the hook of the snake to hang on the head of the jellyfish
small cuts to make the snake be more flexible and looks more real
Jellysnakes mainly live in the water. They reproduce just like jellyfish. The snake legs are produced afterbirth.
This Omni animal is called "JellySnake" as it has the head of jellyfish and legs of snakes.

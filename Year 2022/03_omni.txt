Omni-animal: Flowermingo

Getting Wooden Pieces

Prototyping and Iterating the Model

At first demo, I used the wooden board for the head of my flowermingo, but it was too heavy for the body to support. In the end, I chose real petals (much lighter than wood), pasting them together, as the birdâ€™s head.

Final Omni-Animal

Strictly speaking, flowermingos are creatures between plants and animals.  Continuous wars had caused the ecological environment to be extremely harsh, and the plants that could not bear their surroundings strongly hoped to move to a new place for living. Thus, those plants gradually evolve bird-like bodys and legs, while their flowers became their heads.

Flowermingos will not move around until they are at the end of their lives. Flying a lot to find the final destination, they feed on sunlight and water, dropping petals every few kilometers. When all the petals are gone, they will rest in a new better place, ideally or not.

Meet the Aequator Penguins. A kind of penguin, we find in the hotter regions, somewhere close to the equator. They can withstand moderate to very hot temperatures and are very friendly to humans! Unlike the Galapagos Penguins, they are relatively abundant near coastal regions of South America. They are currently found in most tropical areas of India, Africa, and South America. Aequator penguins are also known as pengsui as the common name. Their body is close to a bluish color. They feed on different kinds of fish, and hence they prefer staying close to the beaches.
 However, humans also have domesticated penguisy in their household and are replacing dogs as the Man's best friend. In many cases, fishermen have started training penguins to fetch fish that they can sell for commercial purposes.

My first thoughts before disassembling the camera were to:
1
Try to salvage and/or utilize the "main" components (lens, screen, buttons, lights)
3
Ideas of what to recreate ranged from a charger, to getting the screen to turn on,
to making an aesthetic art piece, to a telescope from the lens

Disassembling Phase:
I used a screwdriver to easily take apart the camera
There were a series of different boards inside along with the obvious of lenses, lights, batteries, the screen
I am unsure what the orange strips were, my one thought is that they function as the "wires" to send signals to the various boards
Once I saw the hole that the main lens left when it was removed I then had the thought "I could make this a speaker!"

Revision Phase:
I make Bluetooth speakers with my students, so I knew I had the supplies to make this happen
I used a Dremel to remove some plastic for a 9V battery to fit inside the case, as well as had to Dremel down the switch to make it fit in the original button hole
Once I soldered the switch and  glued in the speaker, the last (most challenging) part was to reassemble the case and screw it all back together

Reflection
I wish I paid closer attention when disassembling the case because the most challenging part was reassembling it

As I think about the word "repair" I used to associate it with fixing a current object in order to restore its original function
However, after reading Rethinking Repair, I began to understand that repair is beyond just fixing something, but rather the beauty of repair is that it can become something totally new
Originally, I was so focused on "needing" to use the electronics of the camera that I felt stuck, but once I allowed myself to be okay with not using those components I really enjoyed creating something entirely new within its case

The dissembling process itself is a test for perseverance and creativity
I revised how electric machine works in the process
I observed more closely and had deeper understanding of every pieces when brainstorming for new design
I failed forward

Ultimately, I was saddened that I wasn't able to incorporate more parts from the original object in my redesign, even though I did use scrap parts from around my room
The object I have disassembled is Dreamcast, a home video game console
The object I have disassembled is Dreamcast, a home video game console
Thus, when I disassemble it myself, I do not have a complete idea of its functionality, its pros and cons
It accounts for the durability of the old, but also the appearance of the new”

Before disassembling it, I wish I had learned more about the time when the machine existed, its history, the culture around it, the meaning it carried, and the value people expected from its use back then
If I could have had more depth of feeling and awareness of the object before disassembling it, it might have evoked more of my emotions and thinking
I can then generate more ideas and inspiration when I use the disassembled parts to design new objects
However, I have gained a lot from this disassembly process
It was an enjoyable experience, and I'm proud I didn't destroy or force any part of it during the disassembly
During "decomposing" and "disassembling", I was amazed at how intricately each piece interacted with the other

The object I disassembled is called Dreamcast, it is a  home video game console released by Sega in 1998

(Some of them are a bit too small for me) I had to rethink my design to use the big parts in the end
I embody the online-offline contrast by creating a tape collage to represent the offline experience, highlighting the colorful yet noisy online conversations, while I used soft and solid cotton dyed in red, green, blue and yellow, together with small objects on top that help simulate a dreamlike micro-environment to represent the intimacies of offline experience
Reflection:
Reading Jackson's essay makes me rethink the realtionship between objects and meaning, especially in a world that is so intellectually oriented
In my own practice of dissecting and repurposing an old object, an old flip-phone, I really try to think about its original use and meaning  for people, then how I can develop new, or even opposite meaning in it

I chose to take apart a portable charger
The outside had an aluminum tube protecting it and the only other visible parts were the charger ports (one USB, one Micro USB)
There also was plastic on top and the bottom
I knew there would be a circuit board, battery, and wires connecting them inside
When I began taking the portable charger apart, I had trouble taking the outer plastic casing off
I used a variety of tools and eventually decided I would need to break some of the plastic
Once the top was off, it was easy to slide the rest of the aluminum casing off
A majority of pieces are plastic besides the aluminum casing
A majority of pieces are plastic besides the aluminum casing
There also was a screw
The actual portable charger was made of a circuit board, connected by 2 wires to a battery, as anticipated
The circuit board had a copper wire wrapped around a spool on top, assumably for conducting energy
The aluminum and plastic parts are more decorative and protective, whereas the circuit board and battery are structural

I recently have moved a lot and don't have a lot of materials, and struggled to think of how to repurpose this with what was available
So, I simplified my goal and used the aluminum aspect, the plastic cap on the bottom, and tape to reattach the pieces

Then, I thought it could be repurposed as a dog toy (putting treat inside for my dog to get out)
In the future, I will take apart electronics with more of a plan in place of how to use, and will focus on developing my understanding of how to use these pieces

This process helped me reflect on the ways we must have a plan to critically use technology
As Jackson (2014) illustrated, technology is often made (like the MacBook Pro example) in ways that make it extremely difficult to repair and not necessarily environmentally friendly
Creating and repurposing technology in sustainable ways requires the maker to critically engage with the materials around them in ways that prevent additional waste
This process also made me reflect on the importance of patience
I ended up creating something that is not useful, and so it does not constitute a worthwhile repair or sufficiently salvaging the materials
Repair is a big part of my family traditions as my father and grandfather both are mechanics, and so I was raised in a tradition of repairing whatever we could, and although I have more experience with repairing non-electronics I am looking forward to gaining practice in this realm

The experience of grabbing a microwave from the street's trash, dissecting it, and repurposing the fan was counter-cultural in different ways
The experience of grabbing a microwave from the street's trash, dissecting it, and repurposing the fan was counter-cultural in different ways
First, I felt empowered opening a technological artifact and using various tools traditionally attributed to man
I was used to thinking about repairing technology as a man's task: the person that always fixed artifacts in my home was a man
Second, repairing instead of using new materials was a way to care for the environment and our technologies
Jackson (2014)  invites us to build a strong relationship with objects and take care of them and proposes an ethics of mutual care and responsibility, called repair-centered ethics paradigm

It reminded me the video at Heliopolis work, where students made a ship with a helix repurposing objects
Second Idea

Try out the fan, as I forgot to plug in the microwave to test if it was working
It worked !!!

I decided to put a switch to pick if I wanted to turn it on or off
Megan helped me to use a multimeter to measure the voltage
Fourth idea

Stick metallic and colorful stars in the helix to see a nice effect

It was intriguing to see how the notion of "repairing" was articulated as a "timely phenomenon bridging past and future", namely "aftermath", which inherits the layered world and entails continuity of "order, value, and meaning" (Jackson, 2014)
In my project, the phone slider and the movable monitor stand were manifested as embodied instructional material of the number system and provided the embodied structure of 2 players game, respectively
I think the original purpose of the embodied design affordance was sustained and transformed throughout the “repair” process and the project entails a portion of the essence of the aftermath–continuity (of order and value) and resilience

Serendipitously I figured out that the surface of the stand  is composed of magnet!

Challenge: As soon as I detached the screen from the stand, the vertical spring went back to the top and didn't stay in the middle!!

Inquiry: I wonder what makes the object to stay vs

This way, we can express base 2 or 3 number system using different embodied representation!

Rotating nature of the stand inspired me to build two-player game display

Inquiry: I still cannot figure out what makes the stand neck rotate
